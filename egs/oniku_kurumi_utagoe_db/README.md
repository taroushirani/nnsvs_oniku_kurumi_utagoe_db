## How to use
Due to the licensing issue, this recipe does not include data nor helper scripts for downloading automatically. First of all, you need to get ONIKU_KURUMI_UTAGOE_DB.zip from [御丹宮くるみ Official WEB](http://onikuru.info/db-download/) (the terms of service are written in Japanese). Next, clone this repository and change `db_root` in `00-svs-world/config.yaml` according to your environment. Then move to `00-svs-world` directory and run:

    run.sh --stage 0 --stop-stage 6

The directory structure made by this recipe is the same as kiritan_singing does.
